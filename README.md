# 📂 Week 05: IO Programming, Annotations & Reflection

Welcome to **Week 5** of learning Java! This week, we’ll learn how to work with real-world data (CSV and JSON files), and explore Java’s powerful features like annotations and reflection.

## 🧾 Overview

This week, we’ll:
- Work with **CSV** and **JSON** data files
- Learn how to read and write external data
- Use **annotations** to add metadata to code
- Use **reflection** to inspect or change code at runtime

These tools are useful when working with real-world apps and data.

## 📌 Topics This Week

### 1. CSV Data Handling
- Read data from CSV files using `BufferedReader`
- Write data to CSV files using `FileWriter`
- Split lines into values using `.split(",")`

### 2. JSON Data
- What is JSON and how it's used
- Parse JSON in Java using libraries like:
  - `org.json`
  - `Gson`
  - `Jackson`
- Convert (serialize) Java objects to JSON
- Convert (deserialize) JSON to Java objects

### 3. Annotations, Reflection & Design Principles
- Use built-in annotations (like `@Override`)  
- Create your own custom annotations  
- Use reflection to:
  - Get class/method/field info
  - Change object behavior at runtime
- Learn clean code ideas like:
  - **DRY** (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
  - **SRP** (Single Responsibility Principle)

---

## 💻 Before You Start

Make sure you:
- Know how to work with files in Java
- Understand classes, objects, and Java syntax
- Are familiar with Streams and OOP basics

---

## 📁 How to Use This Repo

- Open each topic folder and check the code examples
- Try running the CSV and JSON programs
- Create your own custom annotation or use reflection to inspect a class

---

## 🔭 What’s Next

Next, we’ll start working with **Spring Boot** to build real Java applications.

> 💡 Knowing how to handle data and use reflection makes your code more powerful and flexible!
